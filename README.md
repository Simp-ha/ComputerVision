# HW1 # Text Recognition using Computer Vision

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to perform text recognition using computer vision. The implementation is done using Python 3.6 and OpenCV v.3.2.17. The following steps are applied to analyze and process an image:

### Workflow

1. **Adding Gaussian Noise**  
   Initially, Gaussian noise is applied to the selected photo that is to be processed and analyzed.

2. **Processing the Original and Noisy Images**  
   For both the original image and the one with noise, the following steps are carried out to achieve the desired results:

### 1. Text Line Detection

The program detects all the lines of text in the document. It displays and saves an image where the different lines of text are highlighted. Specifically, for each text line, a bounding box is drawn, and a unique incremental number is assigned to each line.

### 2. Measuring and Displaying Metrics for Each Line

For each detected line, the following metrics are calculated and displayed as program output:

- **a) Text Area**  
  This is the area occupied by the text, defined as the number of pixels that belong to letters (dark pixels) and not the background (light pixels).

- **b) Bounding Box Area**  
  The area of the bounding box that surrounds the line of text.

- **c) Word Count**  
  The number of words contained in the detected line.

- **d) Average Gray Level**  
  The average gray level of the pixels contained within the bounding boxes of the objects, ensuring that the speed of execution is independent of the sub-region size.

# HW2 # Panorama Generation using OpenCV

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm that generates panoramas from multiple individual images. The implementation is done using Python 3.6 and OpenCV v.3.2.17. The following tasks are examined:

## Tasks

1. **Panorama Generation from at least Four Images**
   The panorama will be generated by stitching at least four images together using the following feature detectors and descriptors:

   - a) SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
   - b) SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)

2. **Evaluation of Panorama Generation Results**
   The results of each generated panorama will be evaluated by calculating the following metrics:

   - **2 - Differential Entropy**
     The differential entropy is calculated as the difference between the average global entropy of the component images and the global entropy of the generated panorama image.

   - **3 - Average Local Entropy for the Stitched Image**
     The local entropy can be computed in sections (neighborhoods) of the image using a sliding window (9x9 pixels). The average local entropy is then calculated for each window position.

   - **4 - Differential Variance of the Local Entropy**
     This is the difference between the local entropy of the panorama image and the local entropy of the component images.

   - **9 - Absolute Difference of Standard Deviations**
     This metric calculates the difference between the standard deviation of the panorama image and the average standard deviation of the component images.

   The entropy-based features (metrics 2-4) can be determined by calculating both the local and global entropy values for the component images and the panorama.

3. **Application of the Algorithm on Four New Images of Any Scene of Interest**
   Implement the panorama generation on four new images from any scene of interest. Perform this process for different camera orientations and varying degrees of scene overlap in consecutive images. Evaluate the generated panoramas using the metrics described in task 2. Conclusions based on the results should be made.
